# Recursion Mech

An educational game that teaches recursion concepts through a mech combat roguelike experience.

## Game Overview

Recursion Mech is an educational game designed to teach computer science students the concept of recursion through engaging gameplay. Players control a series of mechs navigating through procedurally generated rooms, fighting enemies, and upgrading their abilities using coding-related upgrades.

The game is structured as a descent through three floors, each representing a key concept of recursion:
1. **Simplification** - Breaking down complex problems
2. **Recursive Case** - Applying the same solution to smaller instances
3. **Base Case** - Knowing when to stop recursion

Each floor features unique traversal algorithms (depth-first search, breadth-first search, and binary search) that reinforce recursion concepts through gameplay mechanics.

## Key Features

- **Procedurally Generated Rooms**: Combat takes place in randomly generated rooms with varying layouts
- **Coding-Based Upgrades**: Improve your mech with programming-themed upgrades (loops, variables, conditionals)

- **Multiple Search Algorithms**: Experience different traversal methods on each floor
- **Progressive Learning**: Game mechanics gradually build understanding of recursion

## Game Flow

1. **Introduction**: Briefing about the setting, player role, and recursion overview
2. **Tutorial**: Learn basic movement and combat controls
3. **Floor Progression**: Navigate through rooms using different traversal methods
   - Defeat enemies to collect minerals
   - Use minerals to purchase upgrades
   - Apply coding-themed upgrades to your mech
   - Find and defeat the floor boss
   - Complete a quiz to unlock the next floor
4. **Final Challenge**: Obtain "The Answer" upgrade and experience the full recursion cycle
